\description{
Analysis of Line x Tester data containing only Crosses laid out in RCBD or Alpha Lattice design.
}
\details{
Analyzing the line by tester data only using the data from crosses which are evaluated in alpha lattice design. All the factors are considered as fixed.
}
\note{
The block variable is inserted at the last if the experimental design is Alpha Lattice. For RCBD no need to have block factor.

\dontrun{#Line Tester analysis data with only crosses in RCBD

result1 = ltc(rcbdltc, replication, line, tester, yield)

#Line Tester analysis data with only crosses in Alpha Lattice
library(gpbStat)
data(alphaltc)
