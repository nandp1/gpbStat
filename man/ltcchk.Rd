\description{
Analysis of Line x Tester data containing crosses and checks laid out in RCBD or Alpha Lattice experimental design.
}
\details{
Analyzing the line by tester data only using the data from crosses which are evaluated in alpha lattice design. All the factors are considered as fixed.

Analyzing the line by tester data only using the data from crosses which are evaluated in alpha lattice design.
All the factors are considered as fixed.

\note{
The block variable is inserted at the last if the experimental design is Alpha Lattice. For RCBD no need to have block factor.
